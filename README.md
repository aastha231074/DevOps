# What is a server? 
A server is fundamentally a computer system that provided services, resources or data to other computers over a network. Servers can exist in several forms:</br> 
<b> Physical Servers </b>- The actual metal hardware, consisting of processors, memory, storage and network interfaces housed in data centers.

<b> Virtual Servers </b>- Software-based servers that run on physical hardware but are partitioned to act as separate server instances.

<b> Cloud Servers </b>- Vistual servers provided by cloud platforms that you can provision and manage remotely without owining the physical hardware.

## Different Type of Server: 
- Web Servers - Host website and web application 
- Database servers - Store and manage databases 
- File servers - Store and share files across a network 
- Mail servers - Handle email services 
- Application Servers - Run specific software applications 
- DNS servers - Translate domain names to IP addresses 

## What is Cloud?
A bunch of machines running inside a server wharehouse. So now a datacenter is bascially a place where you have a bunch of machines running. Machines is bascially somthing with a processor, storage and RAM etc. This datacenter we refer to as cloud as it exist outside of our machine. 

### Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- <b> On-demand access </b> - You can provision resources instantly without calling anyone or waiting for hardware instalation.  

- <b> Pay-as-you-go </b> - You typically pay only for what you use (compute time, storage space, bandwidth). 

- <b> Scalability </b> - You can quickly scale resources up during high demand or down during quite periods.

- <b> Managed Infrastructure </b> - The cloud provider handles the physical maintenance, security, cooling, power, and networking of the data center. 

### Different Types of Cloud Services 
#### 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- You get: Raw computing resources (virtual machines, storage, networking)
- You manage: Operating systems, application, data, runtime environments 
- Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Virtual Machines
- Like renting an empty apartment - you bring everything else

#### 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- You get: Development platform with runtime environment, databases, web servers
- You manage: Just your application code and data
- Examples: Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku
- Like renting: A furnished apartment - just bring your personal items

#### 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
- You get: Complete, ready-to-use applications
- You manage: Just your data and user settings
- Examples: Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce, Slack
- Like renting: A hotel room - everything is provided

### Deployment Models (Where It Lives)
#### Public Cloud

- Shared infrastructure owned by cloud providers
- Most cost-effective and scalable
- Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud

#### Private Cloud

- Dedicated infrastructure for one organization
- More control and security, but more expensive
- Can be on-premises or hosted

#### Hybrid Cloud

- Combination of public and private clouds
- Sensitive data stays private, less critical workloads use public cloud
- Allows gradual migration to cloud

#### Multi-Cloud

- Using multiple cloud providers simultaneously
- Avoids vendor lock-in, leverages best features from each provider

### Specialized Service Categories
#### 1. Function as a Service (FaaS) / Serverless
- Run code without managing servers
- Pay only when code executes
- Examples: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions

#### 2. Container as a Service (CaaS)
- Managed container orchestration
- Examples: AWS EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine

#### 3. Database as a Service (DBaaS)
- Managed database services
- Examples: AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database
